## Current `app.js` Direction

`app.js` is being reduced from a large all-in-one file into an application orchestrator.

Current known line count after Phase 3.1 daily operations dashboard:

```text
app.js: 4944 lines
```

## Next Frontend Refactor Targets

- Keep `operations`, `transfers`, and deeper accessory movement handlers inside `app.js` until a safer write-flow refactor, because they are tightly coupled to backend writes, stock movements, and operational validations.
- Keep write guards, rollback, persistence verification, and operational save flows inside `app.js` until a dedicated write-flow refactor.
- Operational AI Manager is read-only and must stay based on calculated frontend state unless a dedicated AI backend phase is approved.
- Full operational test is available as `npm run test:operational-full`; it creates real test records on the configured target and should be run intentionally, not as part of normal CI writes.

## Not Allowed Currently

- Backend refactor.
- Database schema changes.
- Calculation changes.
- Waste logic changes.
- Stock logic changes.

## Last Verification

- `npm run test:operational-full`: passed on Railway with order `تيست-mqbmb12s`.
